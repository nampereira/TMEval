You will be given an input text, with a list of Spoofing threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Attack Vectors Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar specific methods or techniques that an attacker might use to impersonate identities or spoof components in the system. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Phishing campaigns targeting user credentials
- Session hijacking
- Credential stuffing using leaked or weak passwords
- API key theft and subsequent API impersonation
- DNS spoofing or ARP poisoning
- Exploiting trust in federated identity providers
- Fake device ID submission
- Manipulating authentication headers in insecure API endpoints

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference spoofing threat list.
2. Identify the attack methods or spoofing techniques described.
3. Compare whether the input includes similar vectors as the reference.
4. Based on your comparison, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Attack Vectors Coverage evaluation criterion.
