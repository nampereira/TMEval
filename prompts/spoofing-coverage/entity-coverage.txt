You will be given an input text, with a list of Spoofing threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Entity Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input includes the same key entities that can be spoofed as those in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- User accounts
- System services or APIs
- Hardware devices
- Application components or microservices

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference spoofing threat list.
2. Identify the entities in both the input and the reference that are susceptible to impersonation.
3. Compare the entities mentioned in the input with those in the reference, checking for alignment and completeness.
4. Based on the analysis above, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Entity Coverage evaluation criterion.
