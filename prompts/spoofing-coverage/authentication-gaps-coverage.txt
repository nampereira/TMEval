You will be given an input text, with a list of Spoofing threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Authentication Gaps Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies comparable weaknesses in authentication mechanisms as those listed in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Basic password vulnerabilities
- Inadequate or missing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) implementation
- Weak or improperly managed session handling
- Exploitable flaws in identity providers or authentication protocols

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference spoofing threat list.
2. Identify the authentication-related gaps or weaknesses mentioned in the input and the reference.
3. Compare whether the input covers the same or comparable authentication weaknesses found in the reference.
4. Based on this analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Authentication Gaps Coverage evaluation criterion.
