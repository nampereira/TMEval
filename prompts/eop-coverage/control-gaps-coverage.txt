You will be given an input text, with a list of Elevation of Privilege threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Control Gaps Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar missing or weak security controls that, if properly implemented, would prevent privilege escalation. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Inadequate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation
- Lack of sandboxing or isolation for untrusted code
- Weak privilege separation between users or processes
- Services running with excessive privileges
- Insecure inter-process communication (IPC)
- Unpatched known vulnerabilities
- Default or overly permissive configurations
- Missing validation on flows that alter permissions or access levels

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Elevation of Privilege threat list.
2. Identify the control weaknesses or gaps mentioned in each.
3. Compare whether the control gaps in the input align with those in the reference.
4. Based on the analysis above, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Control Gaps Coverage evaluation criterion.
