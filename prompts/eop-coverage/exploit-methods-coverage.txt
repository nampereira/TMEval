You will be given an input text, with a list of Elevation of Privilege threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Exploit Methods Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input describes similar techniques used to achieve privilege escalation. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Token theft or impersonation
- Container breakout or escape from sandbox environments
- Exploiting insecure sudo or privilege delegation configurations
- DLL hijacking or binary planting attacks
- Leveraging insecure service or daemon configurations
- Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities or flawed access controls
- Abusing misconfigured Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Elevation of Privilege threat list.
2. Identify the exploit techniques or methods described.
3. Compare whether the input includes similar privilege escalation exploit methods as the reference.
4. Based on your analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Exploit Methods Coverage evaluation criterion.
