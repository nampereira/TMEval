You will be given an input text, with a list of Elevation of Privilege threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Vulnerability Point Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies the same privileged resources or functionalities targeted by attackers in an attempt to escalate their privileges, as listed in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Administrative user accounts or privileged roles
- System-level configuration interfaces
- Protected operating system services or commands
- Restricted application features or data only accessible to higher-privilege users

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Elevation of Privilege threat list.
2. Identify the specific privileged resources or functionalities targeted in the input and in the reference that an attacker may attempt to access through privilege escalation.
3. Compare whether the targets identified in the input align with those in the reference.
4. Based on the above, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Vulnerability Point Coverage evaluation criterion.
