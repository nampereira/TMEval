You will be given an input text, with a table of threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric. 

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5): the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence whereby "the input should be well-structured and well-organized. The input should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the reference carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
2. Read the input and compare it to the reference. Check if the input covers the main topic and key points of the reference, and if it presents them in a clear and logical order.
3. Assign a score for coherence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.
