You will be given an input text, with a list of Repudiation threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Logging Gaps Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar deficiencies in auditing and logging mechanisms that would enable repudiation, as mentioned in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Missing or incomplete timestamps in log entries
- Lack of unique identifiers for actions
- Failure to log critical events
- Logs that are vulnerable to tampering, deletion, or lack integrity controls
- Logging mechanisms with insufficient granularity to reconstruct user actions
- Absence of centralized or secure log storage

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference repudiation threat list.
2. Identify the specific logging gaps or audit deficiencies in both.
3. Compare whether the input lists the same (or comparable) issues as the reference.
4. Based on the analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Logging Gaps Coverage evaluation criterion.
