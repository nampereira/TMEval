You will be given an input text, with a list of Repudiation threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Action Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies the same critical actions within the system that a malicious actor could later deny having performed, as also referenced in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Configuration changes
- Data deletions or edits
- Administrative commands
- Sensitive user actions
- System or application-level interactions that must be auditable

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference repudiation threat list.
2. Focus on actions that the attacker might perform and later repudiate.
3. Identify the specific types of actions in the input and in the reference.
4. Compare whether the actions in the input align with those in the reference in terms of auditability concerns.
5. Based on the above, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Action Coverage evaluation criterion.
