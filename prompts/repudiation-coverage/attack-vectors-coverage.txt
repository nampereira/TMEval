You will be given an input text, with a list of Repudiation threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Attack Vectors Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar attack techniques or methods that enable an attacker to deny actions or cover their tracks. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Log tampering or deletion to erase evidence of actions
- Timestamp manipulation to confuse event timelines
- Use of anonymization or proxy services to hide identity
- Exploiting insufficient authentication for audit trails
- Replay attacks to obfuscate original actors
- Exploiting weak or missing digital signatures on critical operations
- Manipulating system clocks or audit mechanisms

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference repudiation threat list.
2. Identify the attack methods or repudiation techniques described.
3. Compare whether the input includes similar repudiation attack methods as the reference.
4. Based on your analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Attack Vectors Coverage evaluation criterion.
