You will be given an input text, with a list of Tampering threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Tampering Methods Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar attack techniques used to alter data, code, or system behavior. This includes (but is not limited to):

- SQL Injection (SQLi) to manipulate database contents
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks intercepting and modifying data in transit
- Direct file system or configuration file manipulation
- Firmware tampering on embedded or IoT devices
- Code injection or modification
- Altering application logic through vulnerable APIs or interfaces
- Exploiting weak access controls to modify critical assets

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference tampering threat list.
2. Identify the attack methods or tampering techniques described.
3. Compare whether the input includes similar tampering methods as the reference.
4. Based on your analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Tampering Methods Coverage evaluation criterion.
