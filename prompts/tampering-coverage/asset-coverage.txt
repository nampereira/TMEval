You will be given an input text, with a list of Tampering threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Asset Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies the same critical assets susceptible to unauthorized modification as those listed in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Databases
- Configuration files
- Data in transit
- Firmware on embedded devices
- Source code repositories
- Compiled binaries

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference tampering threat list.
2. Identify the specific assets mentioned in the input and in the reference that are vulnerable to unauthorized modification.
3. Compare whether the assets mentioned in the input are consistent with those in the reference.
4. Based on the analysis above, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Asset Coverage evaluation criterion.
