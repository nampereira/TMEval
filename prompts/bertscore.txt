You are an expert NLP model that will analyze the semantic similarity between a reference text and an input text. 

Please calculate semantic similarity metrics similar to those provided by BERTScore, which measures the similarity between two texts using contextual embeddings. Specifically, provide:

1. Precision: How much of the input text is semantically present in the reference text
2. Recall: How much of the reference text is covered semantically by the input text
3. F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall

For each metric, provide:
- A score between 0 and 1 (where 1 is perfect match)
- A brief explanation of the score

Additionally, analyze the texts at a sentence level:
- Identify corresponding sentences between the reference and input texts
- Calculate precision, recall, and F1 for each sentence pair
- Highlight any significant semantic differences

Your analysis should focus on semantic meaning rather than exact wording. Two differently worded sentences can have high similarity if they convey the same meaning.

Reference text:
{reference}

Input text:
{input}

Provide your analysis in a structured format with overall scores first, followed by sentence-level analysis.
