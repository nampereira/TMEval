You will be given an input text, with a list of Information Disclosure threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Protection Gaps Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar missing or weak protection mechanisms aimed at preserving confidentiality of sensitive data, as described in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Absence of encryption for data at rest
- Absence of encryption for data in transit
- Weak or misconfigured access controls
- Lack of proper data masking for sensitive fields
- No Data Loss Prevention mechanisms in place
- Inadequate network segmentation exposing confidential data
- Logging or error messages leaking sensitive information

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Information Disclosure threat list.
2. Identify any gaps in confidentiality-preserving controls mentioned in both.
3. Compare if the protection gaps identified in the input match or align with the reference.
4. Based on the comparison, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Protection Gaps Coverage evaluation criterion.
