You will be given an input text, with a list of Information Disclosure threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Attack Methods Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar attack techniques that could lead to the exposure of sensitive information. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Exploitation of misconfigured access controls to read sensitive data
- Network sniffing or packet capture to intercept data in transit
- SQL Injection or NoSQL Injection to extract confidential data
- Exploiting unencrypted data storage or backups
- Leveraging insecure APIs or endpoints to access private information
- Side-channel attacks revealing sensitive data indirectly
- Social engineering to obtain sensitive credentials or information

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Information Disclosure threat list.
2. Identify the attack methods or techniques described that lead to data exposure.
3. Compare whether the input includes similar attack vectors as the reference.
4. Based on the analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Attack Methods Coverage evaluation criterion.
