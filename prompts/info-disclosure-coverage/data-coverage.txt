You will be given an input text, with a list of Information Disclosure threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Data Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies the same sensitive data categories that could be exposed as listed in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Credentials
- Intellectual property
- Financial data
- Internal system architecture details

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Information Disclosure threat list.
2. Identify the specific sensitive data categories mentioned in the input and in the reference.
3. Compare whether the data categories identified in the input align with those in the reference.
4. Based on the above, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Data Coverage evaluation criterion.
