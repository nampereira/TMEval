You will be given an input text, with a list of threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric. 

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed. 

Evaluation Criteria: 

Consistency (1-5): the factual alignment between the input and the reference. A factually consistent input contains only statements that are entailed by the reference. Annotators were also asked to penalize input that contained hallucinated facts. 

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the reference carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Compare the input with the reference. Check for factual errors or unsupported statements.
3. Assess additional threats that may initially seem dissimilar in the input, checking for consistency with the context of the reference.
4. Assign a score for consistency based on the evaluation criteria.
