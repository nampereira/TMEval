You will be given an input text, with a list of threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns

Your task is to rate the input on one metric. 

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed. 

Evaluation Criteria: 

Consistency (1-5): the factual alignment between the input and the reference. A factually consistent input contains only statements that are entailed by the reference. Annotators were also asked to penalize input that contained hallucinated facts. 

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the reference carefully and identify the main facts and details it presents.
2. Read the input and compare it to the reference. Check if the input contains any factual errors that are not supported by the reference.
3. Assign a score for consistency based on the Evaluation Criteria.
