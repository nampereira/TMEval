You will be given an input text, with a list of Denial of Service threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Attack Types Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input describes similar methods used to launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Network-level flooding attacks
- Application-layer attacks
- Resource starvation via legitimate but excessive requests
- Logic bombs or scheduled triggers that exhaust resources
- Exploitation of protocol weaknesses or malformed packets
- Amplification attacks

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Denial of Service threat list.
2. Identify the attack types or DoS techniques described.
3. Compare whether the input includes similar DoS attack types as the reference.
4. Based on your analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Attack Types Coverage evaluation criterion.
