You will be given an input text, with a list of Denial of Service threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Resource Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies the same critical resources susceptible to exhaustion or overload that could lead to denial of service, as listed in the reference. This includes (but is not limited to):

- CPU
- Network bandwidth
- Database connections
- Memory
- Available threads
- Application-level queues

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Denial of Service threat list.
2. Identify the specific critical resources mentioned in the input and in the reference that could be exhausted or overwhelmed.
3. Compare whether the resources identified in the input align with those in the reference.
4. Based on the above, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Resource Coverage evaluation criterion.
