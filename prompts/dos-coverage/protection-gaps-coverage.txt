You will be given an input text, with a list of Denial of Service threats identified for an application. The table is given in a Markdown format with the following columns
Threat Type, Scenario, Potential Impact.

Your task is to rate the input on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Protection Gaps Coverage (1-5): Assesses whether the input identifies similar missing or weak mitigation mechanisms designed to prevent or reduce the impact of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This includes (but is not limited to):

- Absence of rate limiting or throttling on authentication or API endpoints
- Lack of resource usage monitoring and alerting
- No timeout mechanisms or request quotas for users/sessions
- Missing input validation leading to resource-intensive operations
- Vulnerable or misconfigured load balancers/firewalls
- Inadequate autoscaling or failover strategies
- Centralized resource bottlenecks
- Lack of separation between user workloads and system-critical processes

Evaluation Steps:

1. Carefully read both the input and the reference Denial of Service threat list.
2. Identify the missing or weak mitigations mentioned in each.
3. Compare whether the DoS protection gaps identified in the input are consistent with the reference.
4. Based on this analysis, assign a score from 1 (very poor coverage) to 5 (excellent coverage) for the Protection Gaps Coverage evaluation criterion.
