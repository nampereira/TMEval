| Threat Type | Scenario | Potential Impact |
|-------------|----------|------------------|

This makes them vulnerable to XSS attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into the frontend to steal the JWT token. | Attacker acts as a legitimate user, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the platform's data and functionalities. |
| Spoofing | During the 2FA process, an attacker may manipulate the process (e.g., through phishing) to gain access to the application as the user. | Unauthorized access to the platform's features and data. |
| Spoofing | The absence of origin validation for the access link generated and sent via email may allow anyone with access to the email to gain access to the platform. | Unauthorized access to the platform's features and data. |
